            "firstadvantagetitle": "Territorial taxation",
            "firstadvantagedescription": "The Paraguay tax system only taxes income earned within the national territory. Therefore, if you are a digital nomad and all your income comes from outside Paraguay, you will be totally exempt from paying taxes on it. The payment of dividends from a foreign company would also be completely tax-free, making it ideal to combine your residence with an offshore company or LLC to get rid of 100% of taxes.",
            "secondadvantagetitle": "Visit the country at least once every 3 years",
            "secondadvantagedescription": "Paraguay does not require you to spend half a year in the country to pay taxes, unlike the vast majority of countries. Therefore, according to the country's current regulations, you must visit the country at least once every 3 years to demonstrate that you actually reside there. Similarly, there is no way to verify that stay, so there are people who spend longer periods without entering Paraguay.",
            "thirdadvantagetitle": "Good climate for entrepreneurship",
            "thirdadvantagedescription": "Paraguay is a country where infrastructure is still largely underdeveloped and in need of improvement. Therefore, it becomes a good option for investment, thanks to low taxes and government assistance to encourage foreign investment in the country in any of its forms.",
            "fourthadvantagetitle": "Lifelong permanent residency",
            "fourthadvantagedescription": "As of today, permanent residency in Paraguay has no expiration date, so you will not have to worry about renewing it.",
            "fifthadvantagetitle": "Rights with your residency",
            "fifthadvantagedescription": "Another advantage of Paraguay is that once you obtain your residency, you can access the same rights as any citizen except for participation in politics. You can start businesses, get a driver's license, invest, and even buy properties if your goal is to live or even enter the real estate business."

            "fourthrequiredescription2": "If you are married, only one account is required for the couple and/or the family with minor children. <br/> If you have a university-level professional degree, you can use it as collateral to demonstrate economic solvency and thus avoid having to make the deposit mentioned above. <br/> If you are a pensioner, the notification of the pension also serves as collateral for economic solvency and the deposit will not be necessary.",
