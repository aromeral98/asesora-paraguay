        "paragraph": "Paraguay has become a popular destination for digital nomads due to its favorable immigration policies and liberal economy. The country offers a unique opportunity for remote workers to establish residency and work freely in Paraguay, as well as travel throughout South America without a passport.",
        "paragraph1": "The new immigration law, which was approved in October 2022, allows digital nomads from Europe, the United States, and Canada to apply for residency and the Paraguayan biometric card. This card enables them to work and live freely in Paraguay, without having to deposit $5000 in the central bank as the previous legislation required.",
        "paragraph2": "In addition to its favorable immigration policies, Paraguay's liberal economy supports individual freedom and initiative in both business and labor spheres. It is the only country in South America that stands out for its total economic liberalism, while all other countries have left-wing or even extreme left-wing governments.",
        "paragraph3": "The new immigration law provides a great opportunity for digital nomads, especially recent graduates from Europe and North America, to leverage their skills and qualifications in Paraguay. They can also establish work relationships in other South American countries, as the Paraguayan biometric card allows for travel without a passport.",
        "paragraph4": "Thanks to a new immigration law that went into effect on October 18th, 2022, Paraguay has become a popular destination for digital nomads. One of the biggest benefits for recent graduates and others is the elimination of the $5,000 deposit required to obtain residency.",
        "title1": "A Great Opportunity for Recent Graduates",
        "paragraph5": "Recent graduates who are interested in starting their own businesses can take advantage of this opportunity without having to pay the deposit. And, it's worth noting that this opportunity isn't limited to young graduates. Digital nomads of all ages and industries are welcome to apply for residency in Paraguay.",
        "title2": "Territorial Taxation: A Solution to High Tax Pressure",
        "paragraph6": "Paraguay applies territorial taxation, which means that digital nomads who come to the country to request residency with a signed contract abroad do not have to pay any taxes on the income they generate from their work in Paraguay. This is a significant benefit, especially for those who have been affected by high tax pressure in Europe and North America for years.",
        "title3": "Paraguay: The Only South American Country that Doesn't Tax Compensation of Salaried Employees from Abroad",
        "paragraph7": "In addition to territorial taxation, Paraguay is also the only South American country that doesn't tax the compensation of salaried employees from abroad. This makes Paraguay an even more attractive destination for digital nomads who want to keep more of their hard-earned money.",
        "paragraph7.1": "In conclusion, the new immigration law in Paraguay has eliminated the $5,000 deposit required to obtain residency, making the country a more attractive destination for digital nomads from Europe, North America, South Korea, Japan, Turkey, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. With territorial taxation and no taxes on compensation for salaried employees from abroad, Paraguay truly offers a solution to the high tax pressure problem that many digital nomads face."
